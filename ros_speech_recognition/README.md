# ros\_speech\_recognition

A ROS package for speech-to-text services.  
This package uses Python package [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition) as a backend.

## Tutorials

### Normal tutorial

1. Install this package and SpeechReconition

  ```bash
  sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-speech-recognition
  ```
  
2. Launch speech recognition node

  ```bash
  roslaunch ros_speech_recognition speech_recognition.launch
  ```
  
3. Echo `/speech_to_text`

  ```bash
  rostopic echo /speech_to_text
  # you can get the recognition result
  ```

### Parrotry tutorial

Parrotry mean オウム返し in Japanese

```bash
# english
roslaunch ros_speech_recognition parrotry.launch
# japanese
roslaunch ros_speech_recognition parrotry.launch language:=ja-JP
```

### Streaming recognition with Google Cloud (`GoogleCloudStream`)

In addition to the request/response `GoogleCloud` engine, a streaming engine
`GoogleCloudStream` is available. It uses the bidirectional gRPC
`StreamingRecognize` API and publishes interim hypotheses on
`~voice_interim_topic` while the user is still speaking, then publishes the
finalised utterance on `~voice_topic` as usual.

```bash
roslaunch ros_speech_recognition speech_recognition.launch \
    engine:=GoogleCloudStream \
    language:=ja-JP \
    google_cloud_credentials_json:=/path/to/credentials.json
```

Notes:

* Endpointing combines Google's own `is_final` flag with a stability timer
  controlled by `~google_cloud_endpoint_stable_s` (default: 1.0 s).
* The gRPC session has a 305 s server-side limit; the recognizer reconnects
  lazily on the next audio chunk, so long-running nodes are safe.
* When `~self_cancellation` is enabled, the streaming session is torn down
  while a `~tts_action_names` action is active and reopened automatically
  afterwards to avoid recognising the robot's own voice.

## `speech_recognition_node.py` Interface

### Publishing Topics

* `~voice_topic` (`speech_recognition_msgs/SpeechRecognitionCandidates`)

  Speech recognition candidates topic name.

  Topic name is set by parameter  `~voice_topic`, and default value is `speech_to_text`.

* `~voice_interim_topic` (`std_msgs/String`)

  Interim (non-final) transcript published while the user is still speaking.
  Only valid when `~engine` is `GoogleCloudStream`.

  Topic name is set by parameter `~voice_interim_topic`, and default value is `speech_to_text/interim`.

* `sound_play` (`sound_play/SoundRequestAction`)

### Subscribing Topics

* `~audio_topic` (`audio_common_msgs/AudioData`)

  Audio stream data to be recognized.

  Topis name is set by parameter  `~audio_topic` and default value is `audio`.
